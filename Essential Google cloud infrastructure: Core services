Organization Node:
==================

Organization roles:

---> Org Admin: Controls over all cloud resources, useful for auditing
---> Project Creator: Controls the project creation, control over who can create projects

G-Suite or Cloud Identity:

-> Orgnization will be created when a Google workspace (G-Suite) or cloud identity account creates a Google cloud project.

Workspace or Cloud identity Super admin:

-> Assign the org admin role to some users
-> He is the point of contact in case of recovery issues
-> controls entire lifecycle or cloud identity account organization resource

Org Admin:

-> Define the IAM policies
-> Define the structure of the resource hierarchy
-> Delegate the responsibilities of critical components such as networking, Billing and resource Hierarchy through IAM roles

Folders:
========

-> Folders is the sub-division of Organization.
-> It is a isolation of projects
-> A folder can contain group of projects and sub-folders

Roles:
======

There are three types of IAM roles:

-> Basic
   * Ownner
   * Editor
   * Viewer
   * Billing administrator
-> Predefined
-> Custom
   * Creating our own custom roles with set of permissions and it is not maintained by GCP, which means our custom roles will not be updated, 
   modified and deleted automatically
   
   Members:
   
   There are Five types of members in GCP
   1. Google account
   2. Service Account
   3. google group ---> Collection of users group and we can assign roles/permissions to that entire group.
   4. Cloud Identity
   5. Google workspace domain ---> Virtual group created for all the user accounts created in organization. 
     
   IAM Policies:
   -> IAM policies are allowed to who can access the which resources and what they can do.
   -> IAM policies are made up of bindings, which are associations between one or more members (users, groups, and service accounts) and a role.
   -> IAM policies can be applied at the project level, folder level, or resource level. 
      When an IAM policy is applied at the project or folder level, it is inherited by all resources within that project or folder. 
      This makes it easy to manage access to multiple resources at once.
      
   What if I already have a different corporate directory?
   - Using Google cloud directory sync, It can able to map the users and groups in your existing directory service
   
   Service accounts:
    - To enable the server-to-server communication
    - Three types of service accounts:
       * User-created custom
       * built-in - Compute engines default service accounts
       * Google APIs service account - Runs internal google processes on your behalf
    
    Default Compute engine service account:
    - Automatically created per project with auto-generated name and email address:
      - Name has -compute suffix
    - Role is "project editor"
    - by default its enabled on all instances creates using gcloud or google cloud console
    
    Identity Aware proxy:
    ======================
    
    Enforces access control policies for applications and resources:
    * Identity-bases access control
    * Central authorization layer for applications accessed by HTTPS
         
    Cloud Storage:
    ===============
    
    Choosing a storage class:
    --------------------------
    
    Read < 1 Year ---> Consider Archive storage
    Read < 1 per 90 days? ----> Consider coldline
    Read < 1 per 30days? -----> Consider Nearline
    More often Read/write  ---> Standard
