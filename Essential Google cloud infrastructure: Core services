Organization Node:
==================

Organization roles:

---> Org Admin: Controls over all cloud resources, useful for auditing
---> Project Creator: Controls the project creation, control over who can create projects

G-Suite or Cloud Identity:

-> Orgnization will be created when a Google workspace (G-Suite) or cloud identity account creates a Google cloud project.

Workspace or Cloud identity Super admin:

-> Assign the org admin role to some users
-> He is the point of contact in case of recovery issues
-> controls entire lifecycle or cloud identity account organization resource

Org Admin:

-> Define the IAM policies
-> Define the structure of the resource hierarchy
-> Delegate the responsibilities of critical components such as networking, Billing and resource Hierarchy through IAM roles

Folders:
========

-> Folders is the sub-division of Organization.
-> It is a isolation of projects
-> A folder can contain group of projects and sub-folders

Roles:
======

There are three types of IAM roles:

-> Basic
   * Ownner
   * Editor
   * Viewer
   * Billing administrator
-> Predefined
-> Custom
   * Creating our own custom roles with set of permissions and it is not maintained by GCP, which means our custom roles will not be updated, 
   modified and deleted automatically
   
   Members:
   
   There are Five types of members in GCP
   1. Google account
   2. Service Account
   3. google group ---> Collection of users group and we can assign roles/permissions to that entire group.
   4. Cloud Identity
   5. Google workspace domain ---> Virtual group created for all the user accounts created in organization. 
     
   IAM Policies:
   -> IAM policies are allowed to who can access the which resources and what they can do.
   -> IAM policies are made up of bindings, which are associations between one or more members (users, groups, and service accounts) and a role.
   -> IAM policies can be applied at the project level, folder level, or resource level. 
      When an IAM policy is applied at the project or folder level, it is inherited by all resources within that project or folder. 
      This makes it easy to manage access to multiple resources at once.
      
   What if I already have a different corporate directory?
   - Using Google cloud directory sync, It can able to map the users and groups in your existing directory service
   
   Service accounts:
    - To enable the server-to-server communication
    - Three types of service accounts:
       * User-created custom
       * built-in - Compute engines default service accounts
       * Google APIs service account - Runs internal google processes on your behalf
    
    Default Compute engine service account:
    - Automatically created per project with auto-generated name and email address:
      - Name has -compute suffix
    - Role is "project editor"
    - by default its enabled on all instances creates using gcloud or google cloud console
    
    Identity Aware proxy:
    ======================
    
    Enforces access control policies for applications and resources:
    * Identity-bases access control
    * Central authorization layer for applications accessed by HTTPS
         
    Cloud Storage:
    ===============
    
    Choosing a storage class:
    --------------------------
    
    Read < 1 Year ---> Consider Archive storage
    Read < 1 per 90 days? ----> Consider coldline
    Read < 1 per 30days? -----> Consider Nearline
    More often Read/write  ---> Standard
    
    CloudSQL:
    ==========
    * HA Configuration
    * Backup Service
    * Import/export
    * Scaling
       -> Up: Machine Capacity
       -> Out: Read replicas
    Note: If you want to consider Horizontal Scalability we need to consider the Cloud Spanner
    
    Connecting to the CloudSQL:
    ==========================
    
    -> CloudSQL Connection -----> Connecting within the Google cloud (Same Region) -----> Use Private IP (But this is just performance base recommendation)
    -> CloudSQL Connection -----> Connecting from outside of Google cloud ----> Cloud SQL Auth proxy (Automated SSL rotations)
    -> CloudSQL Connection -----> Connecting from outside of Google cloud  -----> Need manual COntrol over the SSL certs -----> Manual SSL Connection ----> Cannot use SSL ---> Authorized Networks
    
    How to Make the decision for Data storage:
    ==========================================
    
    Start ---> Do you need in Memory store with low latency ----> Memory Store ----> Is your data relational? ----> Is your workload analytics ? ---> Choose Bigquery ----> Work load not analytics and needs 99.999% availability ? -----> Cloud Spanner ---> CloudSQL   
                  (Such as Gaming Apps)                      (Yes)              No                              yes                               Yes                                                                                 yes                   No
    
    
    Cloud Spanner:
    ==============
    -> Cloud Spanner combines the benefits of relational databases strcture with non-relational horizontal scale
       -> Provides High availability
       -> Horizontally scalability
       -> Automatic replication
       -> Regional Redudandcy as well as Zone redundancy
    
    
    Cloud Firestore:
    ================
    -> Suits for highly scalable no-sql database consider using Document DB called Cloud Firestore
    -> Mobile apps, Web and IoT apps at glocbal scale
    -> Live synchornization and offline support
    -> Security features
    
    Cloud Bigtable:
    ===============
    -> Many of the google services uses this service like Analytics, search, gmail, Maps
    -> Ideal for high throughput apps
    -> such as Ad Tech, Fintech, and IoT
    -> Storage engine for many ML apps
    
    Module2: Resource Manager:
    ===========================
    -> A resource belongs to one and only project
    -> Each project is associated with one billing account
    -> Organization contains all the billing accounts
    
    Quotas:
    =======
    
    Quotas defines the how many resources we can create per project
     -> 15 VPC networks/project
    How quickly we can make the API requests in a project: rate limits
     -> 5 admin actions/second (cloud spanner)
    How many resources you can create per region
     -> 24 CPUs region/project
     
     increase: However we can increase the quota in the Google cloud consile or via support ticket
     
     Monitoring And Alerting:
     =========================
