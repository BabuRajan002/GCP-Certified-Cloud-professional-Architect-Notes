Compute Engine:
================
Predefine or Custom Machine types:

-> vCPUs(cores) and Memory(RAM)

Storage:
=======
-> Zonal or regional persistent disk(HDD or SSD)
-> Local SSD
-> Cloud Storage

Disks:
======
-> Standard, SSD or Local SSD
-> Resize disks or migrate instances with no downtime.

===========================================================
VM LifeCycle:
============

   Provisioning ---->   Staging     -----> Running -------> Stopping

-> vCPUS + memory.      IP addr           Startup           Shutdown 
                        internal(VPC)     Script
                        external

-> Root disk            System image      Access SSH|RDP
                        (Cloud storage)
   Persistent Disk

-> Additional Disks     Boot              Modify Use

Shutdown requires on following actions:
========================================
* If we want to upgrade the CPU resources.

Charges for stopped(terminated) VMs:
=====================================
* No need to pay for Memory and CPU resources
* Pay for the Attached disks and Reserved IP addresses.

Compute Engine Machine families:
-> General Purpose (Series E2 and N)
   * E2 Series - Sharedcored  
   * Workload cost optimized Day to day computing at a lower cost
   * Suits for the applications ex: Web serving, App serving, Back off apps, Small-medium databases, Microservices, Virtual Desktops, Development envs
   * N2, N2D, N1 - Balanced price/performance across a wide range of VM shapes
-> Compute optimized (C2 - Series)
   * Compute intensive workloads
   * Per core licensing
   Applications:
   * Gaming (AAA Game servers)
   * AI/ML
   * Ad Serving
   * Media transcoding
   C2-D Series:
   * Ultra high performace for compute intensive workloads
   Apps:
   * Memory-bound workloads
   * Electronic Design Automation (EDA)   
-> Memory optimized (M1, M2 series)
   M1:
    * Ultra high memory workloads upto 4TB of memory
   Apps:
    * Medium in-memory databases such as SAP HANA
   M2:
    * Ultra high memory workloads upto 12TB of memory
   Apps:
    * Large in-memory databases such as SAP HANA
-> Accelerator optimized
